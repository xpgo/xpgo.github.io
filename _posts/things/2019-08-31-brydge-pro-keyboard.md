Brydge, known for its line of keyboards for the [iPad](https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/), recently debuted its newest keyboard, an updated model designed for Apple's 2018 11 and 12.9-inch [iPad Pro](https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/) models. The [new Brydge Pro](http://www.pntrs.com/t/TUJGRkhJR0JGS0lMSkxCRkpFRktK?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.brydge.com%2Fproducts%2Fbrydge-for-ipad-pro-2018) has been highly anticipated by iPad owners who have used Brydge keyboards in the past and prefer the bulk-free Brydge keyboard style.   

I've teamed up with _MacRumors_ videographer Dan Barbera to review the Brydge Pro, so make sure to check out his hands-on video below to get a visual overview of the keyboard and read on for my own review.   

## Design

If you 're familiar with Brydge keyboards, the Bluetooth-enabled Brydge Pro features the same general design as past Brydge options. It is the least bulky of the third-party keyboards for the new iPad Pro models that I've used, and it's my favorite third-party keyboard design by far.

There are two rubber-lined hinged clips on the keyboard that your iPad Pro fits into, which hold it securely in place and mimic a MacBook setup. The clips move forwards and backwards so you can fold it up just like you would a laptop (and when you close it, there are little rubber nubs to prevent the keys from touching the display). Because of the rubber lining, the iPad Pro is secure and stable in the Brydge Pro, but I have noticed that the weight of the iPad Pro can cause to it flip backwards a bit when I pick it up using the keyboard portion.
